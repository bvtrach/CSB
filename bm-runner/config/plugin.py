        Plugins are a flexible way to inject additional scripts/processes to be executed
        at different stages of the benchmark execution.
        A good example would be to start a client to communicate with a server benchmark
        before the server starts accepting connections.

        ----------
        name: str
            Name of the script/process to be executed.
        exec_time: ExecutionTime
            When to execute the script/process (pre, post, cleanup).
        path: Optional[str]
            Path to the script/process. It will look under scripts/plugins

        args: list[str]
            List of arguments to be passed to the script/process.
            It can include one place holder: `{homedir}`.
            This is replaced at runtime with the path of the build directory of the CSB project.

            Whether to forcefully stop the process if it is still running during cleanup.
